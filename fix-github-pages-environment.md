# Fixing GitHub Pages Environment Protection Rules

This document explains how to fix the issue "Branch main is not allowed to deploy to github-pages due to environment protection rules" that occurs when deploying to GitHub Pages.

## Understanding the Issue

GitHub Pages deployments use an environment named `github-pages` that has protection rules. By default, these rules may not include your `main` branch, causing deployment failures.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings**
3. In the sidebar, click on **Environments**
4. Click on the **github-pages** environment
5. Under "Deployment branches and tags", select either:
   - **All branches** (least restrictive)
   - **Protected branches** (if your main branch is protected)
   - **Selected branches** (if you want to specify exactly which branches can deploy)
6. If you selected "Selected branches", add `main` to the list
7. Click **Save protection rules**

This change allows your `main` branch to deploy to the GitHub Pages environment.

### 2. Optimize GitHub Actions Workflow

Make sure your GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) properly references the environment:

```yaml
jobs:
  # Build job configuration...

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    # Explicitly reference the github-pages environment with proper URL
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
      
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

The critical part is the `environment` section that properly references the `github-pages` environment.

### 3. Wait for Permissions to Propagate

After making these changes, it may take a few minutes for the permissions to propagate through GitHub's systems. If you continue to see the error immediately after making changes, wait 5-10 minutes and try again.

## Alternative Solution: Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)

If the above solution doesn't work, you can use a personal access token with the appropriate permissions:

1. Go to your GitHub account settings
2. Click on **Developer settings**
3. Click on **Personal access tokens** â†’ **Tokens (classic)**
4. Generate a new token with these permissions:
   - `repo` (full control)
   - `workflow` (to update GitHub Actions workflows)
5. Use this token in your deployment workflow for authentication

Note: This approach is less preferred as it involves managing secrets and tokens manually.
